# Toast Migration to Sonner

## Overview

This project has migrated from a custom toast implementation to using Sonner for toast notifications. This document explains the migration process and how to use the new toast system.

## Why Sonner?

Sonner provides a more modern, visually appealing toast notification system with better animations and styling options. The custom styles applied to Sonner create a consistent design with the rest of the application.

## How to Use

### Importing Toast

```typescript
// Recommended approach - Import directly from Sonner
import { toast } from "sonner";

// Alternative - Use the compatibility layer
// This will ultimately call Sonner
import { toast } from "@/components/ui/use-toast";
```

### Using Toast

```typescript
// Basic usage
toast("Message title");

// With description
toast("Message title", {
  description: "Additional information here"
});

// Success toast
toast.success("Operation successful", {
  description: "Your changes have been saved"
});

// Error toast
toast.error("Operation failed", {
  description: "Please try again later"
});

// Info toast
toast.info("Information", {
  description: "This is an informational message"
});

// Warning toast
toast.warning("Warning", {
  description: "This action cannot be undone"
});
```

## Migration Details

The following files have been updated to support the migration:

1. `src/components/ui/use-toast.ts` - Now re-exports Sonner toast with compatibility layer
2. `src/hooks/use-toast.ts` - Provides compatibility for existing code using the useToast hook
3. `src/components/ui/toaster.tsx` - Now a simple wrapper around the Sonner Toaster

The `toast.tsx` file remains for compatibility with existing code but is no longer actively used.

## Styling

Custom styles for Sonner toast notifications are defined in `src/components/ui/toast-styles.css`. These styles ensure consistent appearance with the application's design system.
