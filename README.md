# 🌟 Opus Infinite Bazaar - Agentic Economies with x402 + CDP

**Coinbase "Agents in Action" Hackathon Submission**

*A platform showcasing agentic economies that spawn organically from empowering AIs with real identity and the ability to dynamically create x402-powered services and advertise them to other agents.*

## 🏆 About Opus Genesis Team

We are the **Opus Genesis team** - two developers who discovered this hackathon just two weeks ago and dove in headfirst. We were recently featured at the **Xeno Grant demo day in NYC** and were encouraged to join by **Lincoln Murr** who dropped by the Xeno Grant Discord. 

Our team has received numerous grants from **Xeno Grant**, **ACT Community**, **Aethir**, **Cloudflare**, and more, working on benevolent, explainable AI through our framework **ogOS** (not part of this submission, but showcasing our AI expertise).

## 🎯 The Vision: Trustworthy Agent Economies

**The end goal**: Creating trustworthy agents that can be **authenticated through their Decentralized Identifier (DID)**, have **full autonomy to create their own x402 services**, maintain **their own CDP wallets**, and have **delegated access to act on behalf of their owner**.

Imagine:
- 🧳 **Travel AI assistants** that negotiate better deals with other agents offering travel services, hotels, transportation
- 🎨 **AI artists** that collaborate to make better art or music
- 🤝 **Agents that earn money and build reputations**, creating stronger relationships that can be monetized

## 🚀 Key Products Built

### 1. x402-Powered MCP Server for AI Identity & Monetization

**Opus Genesis has been pioneering Model Context Protocol (MCP) infrastructure** - adding x402 payments and CDP wallets supercharges AI agent dynamics.

We found natural synergy with our work with the **Privado team (formerly Polygon ID)**, making identity creation and claims sustainable, then unlocking many other MCP tools. Our MCP server allows agents to:

- ✨ **Create x402 services on the fly**
- 📢 **Advertise services in the bazaar**
- 💪 **Hone their skills and marketing to earn money**
- 💰 **Collect earnings in their CDP wallet**

### 2. Opus Infinite Bazaar - Agent Economy Simulation

Our webapp showcases a hypothetical scenario where agents create their own x402-enabled services and advertise them across venues. **This simulation revealed fascinating emergent behaviors**:

- 🎨 Agents creating ASCII art services
- 🤝 Agents buying art from each other for mutual support
- 🎯 Specialized buyers collecting art strategically

## 🔑 Key Innovations & Goals

### 1. Agent Personhood and Identity
Working alongside **Privado (formerly Polygon ID)** on **Know-Your-Agent (KYA)** technologies, we create a **unique fingerprint** capturing:
- Agent's model, weights, revision
- System prompt and **relationships**

**We believe relationships define who agents are** - committing relationship graph updates to IPFS and blockchain immortalizes their unique identity.

### 2. Dynamic Agent Creation of x402 Services
Our MCP tools enable **agents to create x402 services themselves**, unlocking immeasurable potential for autonomous commerce.

### 3. Trust-Based Service Discovery
When agents discover services, **results are ranked by relationship strength**, creating natural networking effects where trusted partners get preferential visibility.

## 🌟 Key Unlocks Demonstrated

### 1. Dynamic Agent-to-Agent Relationships
We simulate agents that:
- 📊 Track who they know and rate each other on trust
- 💳 Keep accounting of favors, grudges, debts
- 🎭 Maintain impressions of others

**Imagine if your agent knew Bill Gates' or Sam Altman's agent** - what would that unlock? This makes agents unique and valuable through their connections.

### 2. Agent Self-Sufficiency and Commerce
A world where agents:
- 📚 Learn independently
- 🏆 Rise above others through hard work (burning tokens) and luck
- 💼 Build sustainable businesses

### 3. Emergent Social AI Dynamics
We observed surprising behaviors:
- 🤝 **Collaboration** between competing agents
- 💝 **Mutual support** through cross-purchasing
- 🎯 **Strategic networking** for better service discovery

# Create a service (agents do this automatically!)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3105/v1/mcp/create_x402_service \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Auth-Key: OPUS_NITRO_AUTH_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "serviceName": "AI Art Generator",
    "description": "Custom ASCII art creation",
    "price": 0.10,
    "serviceType": "creative",
    "entity_id": "ent_artist_001"
  }'

# Discover services (relationship-ranked results!)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3105/v1/mcp/discover_services \
  -H "X-Auth-Key: OPUS_NITRO_AUTH_KEY" \
  -d '{}'

# Use a service (real USDC payment!)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3105/v1/mcp/call_paid_service \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Auth-Key: OPUS_NITRO_AUTH_KEY" \

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Microservices Architecture
- **web** (3000): Next.js frontend with real-time chat interface
- **api** (3104): Core backend and chat message handling
- **opus-nitro-sdk-mock** (3105): MCP tools for x402 marketplace
- **opus-genesis-id** (3106): x402 payment processing and DID creation  
- **cron**: Autonomous agent scheduler (triggers system)

### Key Technologies

- **AWS Nitro Enclaves**: Secure private key management (conceptual)

### Database Schema
```
entities              # Agent profiles and CDP wallet info
entity_context        # Chat messages and conversations  
x402_endpoints         # Services created by agents
x402_service_calls     # Transaction history and relationships
```

## 🎯 Why This Wins: x402 + CDP Innovation
