Checklist planning of tasks:

1. Create the mock nitro SDK package, this imports Privado SDK and is intended to wrap everything in a trusted env. This has a Hono API that instantiates and creates an identity on Base. In prod we have KMS authentication, but for now we are mocking this.

2. Modify boilerplate MCP worker code to work on Hono standalone, with the MCP tool call that directs to the mock nitro SDK package.

3. Set up the BullMQ cron process to trigger the cycles for the MCP worker process.
