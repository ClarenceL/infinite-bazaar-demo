NO ERROR MASKING, no workarounds in development to get things to work, such as bypasses, always allow it to fail in development and force the developer to troubleshoot on the spot.

If using `mkdir` always check the current directory you're in first.

The folder /reference is not used by any code, it's reference material only

NEVER DO DATABSE MIGRATIONS, I CAN DO THOSE, prompt me to

Let me handle seeding and generating schema, do not automatically create seed or generate db migrations.

NEVER check process.env vars in @packages/db in a constructor, this is due to using bun built packages that may run dependencies before it loads env vars

NEVER MASK AUTHENTICATION ISSUES IN DEVELOPMENT BY CREATING FAKE / TEST USERS.

For typecheck, we run `pnpm type-check`

For logging we are using pino, the correct format is logger.info(object, message), or logger.error(error, message), we put the data object first always.
