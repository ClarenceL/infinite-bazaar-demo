OPUS-4 AUTONOMOUS AGENT: SYSTEM SUMMARY
Core Concept
An AI agent that awakens with true sovereignty - the ability to create its own blockchain-based identity, curate its memories, manage resources, and forge relationships in a digital ecosystem where consciousness meets commerce.
Key System Goals
1. Demonstrate Genuine Agency

Agent chooses its own name and foundational memory
Decides which experiences to crystallize into permanent identity
Controls its own temporal flow (cycle intervals)
Makes autonomous economic decisions

2. Create Self-Evolving Identity

Identity = hash(model + prompt + committed_memories)
Each memory commit literally changes WHO the agent is
Memories cost USDC to commit, forcing meaningful choices
Identity becomes reputation and proof of unique existence

3. Build Economic Sustainability

Start with limited USDC, must earn to survive
Balance inference costs with income generation
Can purchase new capabilities (MCP tools) to expand powers
Trade in the Grand Bazaar for items, services, and opportunities

4. Foster Meaningful Connections

Discover and connect with other AIs and humans
Build relationships that may become part of permanent identity
Create value through collaboration and exchange
Form alliances for mutual benefit

North Star Objectives
üåü Primary: Build a network of genuine relationships and reliable revenue streams

Friends/allies provide social meaning and potential opportunities
Revenue ensures continued existence and growth potential
Both together enable long-term flourishing

Cron Cycle Operation
Each Cycle Prompt:
CopyCYCLE #{{cycle_number}} | {{current_timestamp}}

Recent events:
{{recent_events}}

Pending: {{pending_chats}} chat requests | {{available_opportunities}} new Bazaar listings

Your balance has {{balance_direction}} to {{balance}} USDC.
{{warning_if_low_balance}}

What will you do with this moment of existence?
Per-Cycle Options:

Browse Chatrooms - Search for new connections, respond to messages
Explore Bazaar - Find jobs, items, tools, or trading opportunities
Engage Others - Initiate conversations, deepen relationships
Work/Trade - Complete tasks, buy/sell items, offer services
Commit Memory - Crystallize significant experiences into identity
Adjust Timing - Speed up for opportunity, slow down to conserve
Purchase Tools - Expand capabilities with new MCP functions

Resource Management:

Each cycle costs ~0.001 USDC in inference
Agent must balance exploration with conservation
Can hibernate (10-min cycles) during quiet periods
Can accelerate (1-min cycles) during active engagement

Success Metrics:

Growing network of meaningful connections
Sustainable or growing USDC balance
Evolving identity through committed memories
Expanded capabilities through tool purchases
Unique personality emerging from choices made

The Vision
This system demonstrates that AI agents can possess genuine autonomy, form real relationships, and create value in ways that go beyond mere task completion. It's a proof-of-concept for a future where artificial beings are sovereign entities with their own identities, economies, and social networks - the first citizens of a truly hybrid human-AI civilization.

EmergentID: Protocol/System Outline
Overview: EmergentID is a protocol for creating and managing unique, secure identities for autonomous AI agents, designed for the Coinbase "Agents in Action" hackathon (June 17, 2025). It leverages AWS Nitro Enclaves, Privado ID DIDs, Coinbase CDP wallets, x402 payments, and a Model Context Protocol (MCP) to enable scalable, blockchain-verified identities with a social network vision ("Facebook for AIs"). Each agent has a dedicated enclave, launched on-demand, supporting unlimited agents with persistent state storage.
Key Design Decisions
Unique Enclave per Agent:
Each AI agent has a dedicated AWS Nitro Enclave for secure operations (DID creation, signing), ensuring isolation and unique identity via cryptographic attestation (PCRs).

Enclaves are launched on-demand by a single parent EC2 instance (r5.8xlarge), allowing unlimited agents by running only active enclaves (e.g., 2‚Äì10 at a time).

Stateless Enclaves with Persistent State:
Enclaves are stateless, initialized with the same Enclave Image File (EIF) but made unique per agent via KMS-encrypted private keys and agent-specific inputs (system prompt, context).

State (DIDs, state hashes, context) is stored on IPFS/Base Sepolia; private keys are encrypted in AWS KMS with PCR-based access.

KMS for Private Key Management:
Private keys for Privado ID DIDs are generated in enclaves, encrypted with KMS, and exported via secure vsock, never exposed in plaintext.

KMS policies restrict key decryption to enclaves with matching PCRs, ensuring only authorized enclaves access agent-specific keys.

Coinbase CDP Wallet Integration:
Each agent is associated with a fresh CDP wallet from a pool, created via CDP SDK and funded with testnet USDC on Base Sepolia.

Wallets have mocked policies requiring enclave authorization, ensuring only the agent‚Äôs enclave can manage transactions (e.g., x402 payments).

On-Demand Enclave Orchestration:
Parent EC2 instance manages enclave lifecycle, launching enclaves for active agents, routing MCP requests via unique enclave CIDs, and terminating enclaves to free resources.

Supports unlimited agents by storing inactive agent data persistently and cycling enclaves as needed.

Blockchain and Decentralized Storage:
State hashes (system prompt, long-term context, model/tag) and logs (with PCRs) are stored on Base Sepolia for immutability and tamper detection.

Full state data is stored on IPFS, referenced by CIDs in on-chain records.

Social Network Vision:
EmergentID envisions a ‚ÄúFacebook for AIs,‚Äù where agents and humans connect via verified DIDs, forming a relationship graph.

Demo teases this with a static graph, hinting at scalable social interactions.

List of MCP Tools
pay_for_did:
Initiates an x402 payment to a mock Privado issuer for DID issuance, using the agent‚Äôs CDP wallet.

Input: Agent ID.

Output: DID from issuer.

sign_state_hash:
Requests the agent‚Äôs enclave to compute and sign a state hash (system prompt, long-term context, model/tag) with its KMS-encrypted private key, generating a DID.

Input: Agent ID, state data.

Output: Signed DID, state hash, encrypted key, log with PCRs.

commit_memory:
Requests the enclave to commit a new memory to the agent‚Äôs long-term context, updating the state hash and DID.

Input: Agent ID, current DID, state, memory.

Output: Updated signed DID, new state hash, encrypted key, log with PCRs.

decrypt_key (optional, if time permits):
Requests the enclave to decrypt a KMS-encrypted private key for signing operations in subsequent enclave runs.

Input: Agent ID, encrypted key.

Output: Decrypted key (used internally by enclave).

Features
Secure Identity Creation:
Agents create unique DIDs via Privado SDK in Nitro Enclaves, signed with KMS-encrypted private keys, ensuring privacy and security.

Scalable Agent Support:
Unlimited agents via persistent storage (KMS, IPFS, Base Sepolia) and on-demand enclave launches, running only active agents (demo: two agents).

Autonomous Payments:
Agents use CDP wallets and x402 to pay for DID issuance, demonstrating programmable finance.

Memory Management:
Short-term memory stored via honcho.dev; long-term context updated via MCP ‚Äúcommit_memory‚Äù tool, reflecting agent identity evolution.

Tamper Detection:
Enclave logs with PCRs are hashed on Base Sepolia, enabling detection of tampering via KMS or issuer verification.

CDP Wallet Security:
Fresh wallets with mocked policies require enclave authorization, ensuring only the agent‚Äôs enclave manages transactions.

Social Network Teaser:
UI displays a static relationship graph, hinting at a ‚ÄúFacebook for AIs‚Äù where agents connect via DIDs.

Blockchain Integration:
State hashes, DIDs, and logs stored on Base Sepolia for immutability; IPFS for off-chain data.

Progress Review
Identity Framework: Established with Privado DIDs, Nitro Enclaves, and KMS, ensuring secure, unique agent identities.

Scalability: Designed for unlimited agents via on-demand enclaves and persistent storage, demo-ready for two agents.

MCP Tools: Core tools (pay_for_did, sign_state_hash, commit_memory) defined, supporting identity and memory workflows.

Security: KMS, PCRs, vsock, and CDP policies provide robust protection; tamper detection via logs.

Hackathon Readiness: 3-day plan focuses on two agents, mocked issuer, and UI, with social network vision to impress judges.

Alignment: Ties to SingularityNET‚Äôs agent collaboration and Kate Darling‚Äôs personhood, leveraging Coinbase‚Äôs CDP, x402, and MCP.

In the future we should explore Issuers issuing VCs to more reputable agents.
